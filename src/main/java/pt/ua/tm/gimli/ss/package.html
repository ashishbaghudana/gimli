    Provides a Sentence Splitter implementation. It was trained using two
    corpora: JNLPBA and PennBioIE Oncology. A total of 3561 abstracts was used
    for training procedures.
    <p>
        In order to evaluate the performance of this solution, we merged the
        corpora and split it in two parts (both parts contain equivalent
        proportions of each corpus.):
        <ul>
            <li>Training: 2867 abstracts</li>
            <li>Testing: 694 abstracts</li>
        </ul>
        
        After training the CRF Model using the training corpus, Gimli SS
        achieved the following results in the test corpus:
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Accuracy: 99.89%</strong></li>
            <li>Precision: 99.91%</li>
            <li>Recall: 99.91%</li>
            <li><strong>F1: 99.91%</strong></li>
        </ul>
        We also made a study of the splitting speed, considering that each
        abstract contains an average of 7 sentences:
        <ul>
            <li><strong>5.3 milliseconds</strong> per abstract.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
